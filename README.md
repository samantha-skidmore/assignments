This is my Assignments Folder with V School.

I have a /completed folder that has the assignments that are complete.

I have a /working-on folder which has the assignments that I have started working on but are not complete.

I have a /projects.assign.folder which is the projects that I have completed.

I would like to be able to go through everything again at a later date and improve them.  At the very least my hope is to go through the projects and clean them up and keep the originals to see where I have come.

The /projects.assign.folder is where I put my projects for my classmates to see but I do have a separate projects folder repository that I keep all of my working in progress projects.
