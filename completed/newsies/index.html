            <p> I didn’t want to give this talk. I didn’t want to talk, not in Church, not at home, and especially not to God.
                How can I give a talk when all I want is to be mad? To make matters even worse I was asked to talk on Faith.
                Well, I had decided to give up on Faith. Faith wasn’t working for me anymore. I tried Faith for 40 years
                and like a 40 year old dress, I didn’t like the way it fit and it was full of holes and wrinkled and had
                become dingy. True, I could have paid more attention to it through the years, I could have mended the holes
                when they appeared, rather than just allowing them to get bigger, I could have washed and ironed it regularly
                rather than ignoring it at the bottom of the laundry basket until it had become mildewed. In all honesty,
                it always fit, I just got tired of the dress. I liked to wear it when I was happy but I hated it when I was
                sad. I liked to wear it whenever Tim had a good job but hated to wear it when he didn’t. I thought it was
                the cutest dress ever when my kids didn’t fight, or talk back, or have melt downs. Lately, I have just wanted
                to throw that dress away.

            <p>In the April 2009 General Conference, Elder Henry B. Eyring gave a talk on Adversity. <b>Adversity and a 40 year old
            dress have everything in common.</b> And I quote: <i>“With all the differences in our lives, we have at least one challenge
            in common. We all must deal with adversity. There may be periods, sometimes long ones, when our lives seem to
            flow with little difficulty. But it is in the nature of our being human that comfort gives way to distress, periods
            of good health come to an end, and misfortunes arrive. Particularly when the comfortable times have gone on for
            a while, the arrival of suffering or the loss of material security can bring fear and sometimes even anger. The
            anger comes at least in part from a feeling that what is happening is unfair. The good health and the serene
            sense of being secure can become to seem deserved and natural. When they vanish, a feeling of injustice can come.
            Even a brave man I knew wept and cried out in his physical suffering to those who ministered to him: “I have
            always tried to be good. How could this happen?”</i>  End Quote.

            <p>That aching for an answer to <i>“How could this happen?”</i> becomes even more painful when those struggling include
                those we love, or to ourselves. And it is especially hard for us to accept when those afflicted seem to us
                to be blameless. Then the distress can shake faith in the reality of a loving and all-powerful God. Some
                of us have seen such doubt come to infect "a" whole generation of people in times of war or famine. Such
                doubt can grow and spread until some may turn away from God, whom they charge with being indifferent or cruel.
                And if unchecked, those feelings can lead to loss of faith that there is a God at all.

            <p>For years, I have wanted to build my own house. You know, pick out the floorplan, choose the flooring and
                    the appliances and the light fixtures. Have a contractor build it just the way I wanted. It is my dream
                    to plan and design and have built just what I want. I didn’t think it was too much to ask for. I was
                    willing to work hard and I had always been good. I was always obedient, my mom will tell you, I never
                    rebelled. I never talked back. I was always good and I thought good things always happen to good people.
                    I wanted to build a house, not be the house. In the book, Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis he describes
                    it this way: <i>“Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps,
                    you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof
                    and so on; you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts
                    knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make any sense. What on
                    earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought
                    of - throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards.
                    You thought you were being made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends
                    to come and live in it Himself.”</i>  End Quote.
            </p>

                <p>I am beginning to understand and realize that for now I am the house that is getting built. And God is knocking
                    me around in a way that hurts abominably and doesnʼt make sense to me. And even when I know in my head
                    that God will deliver us through our trials, it tests our courage and strength to survive. Our family
                    lived in Missouri for a season and I remember our visit to Liberty Jail. The Prophet Joseph Smith cried
                    out in agony in a dungeon: <i>“O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding
                    place? How long shall thy hand be stayed, and thine eye, yea thy pure eye, behold from the eternal heavens
                    the wrongs of thy people and of thy servants, and thine ear be penetrated with their cries?”</i>
                </p>

                <p>The Lordʼs reply has helped me and can encourage us all in times of darkness. Here it is: <i>“My son, peace
                        be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; “And then, if
                        thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes. “Thy friends
                        do stand by thee, and they shall hail thee again with warm hearts and friendly hands. “Thou art not
                        yet as Job; thy friends do not contend against thee, neither charge thee with transgression, as they
                        did Job.”</i> That is from the 121st Section of the Doctrine and Covenants. We hear that quote a lot,
                        but what we don’t always hear is what was happening to the wives and children of those men. They
                        were forced to walk back toward the East in that winter many without shoes.
                        </p>
                
                <p>So this is what I think God is saying to me and probably will say or has said to you. He wants to give
                        me all I want but first, and C.S. Lewis said it better than I can: He says, <i>“Give me all of you!!!
                        I don’t want so much of your time, so much of your talents and money, and so much of your work. I
                        want YOU!!! ALL OF YOU!!! I have not come to torment or frustrate the natural man or woman, but to
                        KILL IT! No half measures will do. I don’t want to only prune a branch here and a branch there; rather
                        I want the whole tree out! Hand it over to me, the whole outfit, all of your desires, all of your
                        wants and wishes and dreams. Turn them ALL over to me, give yourself to me and I will make of you
                        a new self---in my image. Give me yourself and in exchange I will give you Myself. My will, shall
                        become your will. My heart, shall become your heart.”</i>  End Quote.

                <p>I have finally realized that we are not Heavenly Fatherʼs “adults” and I nor you have ever heard us called
                        that, we are and we are called Heavenly Fatherʼs “children” and as such we are still the child. We
                        have to do our chores before we get to do our play. Is that not what we teach our children and why
                        we teach it, is to make them the best they can be. It is my choice whether to take my dress of faith
                        out of the laundry bag or not. It is my choice whether to wash it and mend it and iron it and wear
                        it. My Heavenly Father always lets me choose. He knows what looks best on us, what is best for us,
                        but he allows us to have our meltdowns, to toss our dress across the room, to stomp on it and say
                        we are never going to wear that dress again, itʼs ugly! But in all our meltdowns he never stops loving
                        us and holding out his hand, and when we are finished and calm and are willing to hold his hand again,
                        he picks up our burden and walks with us.
