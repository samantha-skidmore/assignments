                <h3>Good Timber</h3>

            <h4>By: Douglas Malloch</h4>
    
        <p>The tree that never had to fight For sun and sky and air and light, But stood out in the open plain And always got
            its share of rain, Never became a forest king But lived and died a scrubby thing.</p>

        <p>Good timber does not grow with ease: The stronger wind, the stronger trees; The further sky, the greater length;
            The more the storm, the more the strength. By sun and cold, by rain and snow, In trees and men good timbers grow.
        </p>

        <p>Where thickest lies the forest growth, We find the patriarchs of both. And they hold counsel with the stars Whose
            broken branches show the scars Of many winds and much of strife. This is the common law of life.</p>

            <h3>Defining Moments</h3>
                
    <p>We all have defining moments in our lives where the trajectory of where we "thought" we were going changes.</p>
    
        <p>Some moments can be easy to share and others can be more difficult.  I will get back to this at a later date but for now here are my bullet points:</p>

        <p><ul>
            <li>High School Boyfriends and Dating...or lack there of.</li>
        
            <li>Waiting for the boyfriend...and then the missionary.</li>
        
            <li>Waiting to be a Mom.</li>
        
            <li>Depression in Colorado.</li>
        
            <li>Going back to school at 47.</li></ul></p>
